Welcome to my first blog post on github!

I will now test several different markdown styles

## Two pounds

### Three pounds

#### Four pounds

- Dashing creates a bulleted list
- like this and
- like this
  - and this should be an indented list item

1. Gives me an ordered list
2. second element in list
3. third

- _italics_ will make this sentence in italics?
- **bold** will bolden this sentence
- 'code()' designates that the following lines will be code
- 'code()' I suppose this will also be treated as code
- I doubt this will be treated as code

> This creates a blockquote
>> this nests another blockquote

```python
/*some python code to show triple '`' functionality*/
for element in aList:
  print element
```

Let's see how trailing spaces work  
so does this work?  
did this create another linebreak

Horizontal lines
