Welcome to my first blog post on github!

I will now test several different markdown styles

## Two pounds

### Three pounds

#### Four pounds

- Dashing creates a bulleted list
- like this and
- like this
  - and this should be an indented list item

1. Gives me an ordered list
2. second element in list
3. third

- _this will make this sentence in italics?_
- **will bolden this sentence**
- `designates that this sentence is acutally code`
- `I suppose this will also be treated as code`

> This creates a blockquote
>> this nests another blockquote

```python
#some python code to show triple '`' functionality
for element in aList:
  print element
```

Horizontal lines
