I develop predictive models using various machine learning techniques. To date, I've focused on fitness and financial applications but I enjoy tackling new and complex problems, particularly in interdisciplinary fields. I am experienced in data manipulation, complex statistical analysis, and interactive data visualizations.

I am currently enrolled in SMU's Master's in Data Science program which is broadening my perspective and approach to Big Data solutions. I've also developed my skills as part of the Metis Data Science immersion program, which takes a project-based approach to developing data science professionals.

I'm proficient in Python (pandas, sci-kit learn, BeautifulSoup), Java, SAS, R, SQL, NoSQL, supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. 

Feel free to contact me.
